        <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed
            as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is
                necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or
                to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or
                required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>

                perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery,
                hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing Communications:</strong> With your consent, or with an opportunity for you to withdraw
                consent, we may share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or
                during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a
                portion of our business to another company.</li>

                require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.
            While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware
            that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data
            transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

        <h2>5. Policy for Children</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 18. If we learn that we
            have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we
            will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

        <h2>6. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
            activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
            and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
            finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are a resident in India, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the
            processing of your personal data. These rights include:</p>
